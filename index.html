              The Undivide Project is building a dashboard to help communities
              facing environmental and climate injustice connect with businesses
              and foundations that can support them. Plotted on the map are 15
              U.S. cities of focus, with high numbers of people of color and
              low-income residents who are subjected to a disproportionate
              burden of environmental hazards. These communities have also
              expressed a strong desire to address the intersection between
              climate change and the digital divide, the gap between those with
              internet access and those without it. To understand how we
              identified these cities, check out the 'Data' tab.

              As part of our 'Ten States Project' (feel free to ask more about
              it!), our team conducted an international survey of emergency
              managers, disasterologists, planners, resilience professionals,
              academics, and NGOs, asking questions like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Are you aware that communities affected by the digital divide
                are also more vulnerable to climate change?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do you know how the digital divide impacts rural and BIPOC
                communities differently than others?
              </li>
              <li>
                Have you collaborated with local governments, non-profits, or
                private sector entities to address the digital divide and its
                link to climate change?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We overlaid the coordinates of these responses with the EPA's
              Environmental Justice (EJ) screening tool data, which identifies
              areas facing environmental and socio-economic challenges. Then, we
              added in field data from OpenStreetMaps, highlighting communities
              with limited access to essential resources such as clean drinking
              water and public buildings. This comprehensive analysis resulted
              in a heatmap that identified 15 cities.
